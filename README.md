# gnucash-pot #
(Gettext) Portable Object Template of GnuCash

## Motivation ##
Because gnucash.pot is a generated file, it is not part of the gnucash repository. But not all potential translators have the build environment to generate the file.

## Updates ##
On demand, but usually 2 weeks before a [Gnucash Release](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Release_Schedule), a recent gnucash.pot will be uploaded here.

## Usage ##
Select a label and download the file instead of [Get a fresh template](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Translation#Get_a_fresh_template).
